# Megamix Engine

Game Maker Studio Mega Man Engine, forked from the
[Mega Engine](http://sprites-inc.co.uk/showthread.php?tid=1648).

# Netplay

This branch is a staging ground for a more general game-agnostic gml netplay implementation. To demo what is currently available, download [this test room](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/541015723258937354/544242823231176730/lvlPit_NaOH_TreadLightly.room.gmx.zip), and load it externally in the engine. Press 'r' to begin saving to the resimulation buffer. After a second has gone by, press 'r' again to resimulate the past 32 frames, or press 'q' to continually resimulate.

Note that netplay is not yet implemented -- only the serialization/resimulation aspect!

## What is it?

A complete, accurate, and extensible engine for making NES-style
Mega Man fangames.

## Who can use this?

Anyone is free to use this engine or any portion of it so long as
it is for a non-commercial cause. Commercial applications are
